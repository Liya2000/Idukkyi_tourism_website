					<p class="content">The word Idukki is derived from the Malayalam language, meaning narrow ravine/gorge. We all know about the existence of one of the most beautiful state of India, â€œKerala". Well yes, Idukki is one of the 14 districts of Kerala. It was created on 26 January, 1972. It had its headquarters at Kottayam, and then it was moved to Painavu in June 1976, where it is proposed to build a new planned forest township. There is no clear evidence whether men of the paleolithic age lived here or not; but stone-age civilization is present here. It's one of the most talked about place which has a unique history.</p>
